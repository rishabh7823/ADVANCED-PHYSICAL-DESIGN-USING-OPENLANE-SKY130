chip are called as package and package are given name as QFN-48 Quad Flat No-leads.chip is fixed at the centre of the package as shown in the figure

components of chip 

PADs-pads" refer to the small, exposed areas of metal on the edge of a chip's die that provide a larger surface area for connecting external wires or components to the chip, essentially acting as the points of contact for input and output signals and power supply to the chip itself

CORE-is the place where digital logic gates are placed

DIE-The die is the material that the circuit is made on. In the context of silicon wafers, it’s going to be made of silicon.

Foundry IP-Foundry IP" refers to "Foundry Intellectual Property," which essentially means intellectual property (like patents, trademarks, or designs) that is managed or handled by a company called "Foundry,

MACROS-macros refer to pre-designed blocks or functional units that can be reused in different designs. These macros can include standard cells (like logic gates), memory blocks (like SRAM), or complex blocks (like analog circuits or processor cores).

SKY_L2 - Introduction to RISC-V


RISC-V, pronounced "risk-five," is an open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) used in chip design, essentially a set of rules defining how a processor should operate, that allows developers to create custom processors for various applications

for example -While RISC-V itself is not a programming language like C, C code can be compiled into machine code that is executed on a RISC-V processor. The compiler translates the C instructions into the appropriate RISC-V assembly language instructions, which are then executed by the processor.

SKY_L3 - From Software Applications to Hardware

From software to hardware" means moving from the set of instructions or programs (software) that tell a computer what to do, to the physical components (hardware) that actually execute those instructions

Compiler-A compiler is a computer program that translates source code written in a high-level programming language into machine code or another programming language

OP-An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. It manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware.

Assembler-An assembler is a computer program that converts assembly language into machine language. This allows a computer to directly communicate with its hardware.

SKY_L2 - Simplified RTL2GDS flow

An RTL model, which stands for "Register Transfer Level" model, is a design abstraction used in digital circuit design to describe the behavior of a circuit by focusing on the flow of data between registers and the logical operations performed on that data

  * Every time the nethist is madified  , verification  must be performed
 
  * 1. CTS modified the nethlist

    2. Post pLacement optimization modifies the nethist

  * LEG is used to formally confirm that the function did not change after modifying the nethist dealing with Antenna Rules violation

OpenLane is an open-source platform for silicon implementation in VLSI (very large scale integration). It's used to construct digital ASIC physical implementation flows OpenLane's flow includes synthesis, floor planning, placement, clock tree synthesis, routing, RC extraction, STA, sign-off steps, and GDSII extraction.

OpenLane is free to use and modify. 

OpenLane can be customized with Python scripts and utilities. 

OpenLane supports tools like Yosys, OpenROAD, Magic, and KLayout.

1) Type cd Desktop -where "cd" stands for "change directory" and "desktop" refers to the Desktop folder on your computer,then go to work/tools this wher our files r saved

2) ls -ltr  --will list the contents in the folder in chronological order

3)next cd openlane and list the contents of this folder type ls -ltr

4)to check contents of pdk  type cd pdk n ls -ltr

5)in pdk we can see sky130a, cd sky130a will show contents which contain libs.tech. libs.tech contains all tool specific files

folder run  27-01_11-02 is created inside the picorv32a directory which contains the command log files, results, and the reports dumped of the various tool. The folder will be only have the lef files generated by this design setup stage. The cell LEF files .lef and technology LEF files .tlef merge to generate merged.lef inside runs/tmp/, wherein a a folder with today's date will be created, inside which a tmp folder will have contents, and the merged.lef folder will contain the merged lef files.

after run synthesis ,printing statistics as shown below can be used to calculate flip-flops ratio

Flip flop ratio =no of DFFs/no of cells *100

1613/18036*100 = 8.94%

After this, type the command run_synthesis to run synthesis which converts an abstract netlist into a program to run yosys RTL synthesis, ABC scripts (for technology mapping) and openSTA
